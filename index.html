                    <h3> Background </h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born in New Delhi, India on 12th July, 2007 and lived there until the age of 11 and the experiences I had there make me the person I am today. Since I was a kid, I was very inquisitive and was always fascinated by various technological feats in this world. I attended St. Thomas’ School in India upto grade 7.

                    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
                    <p>
                        I have always been fascinated by airplanes for as long as I can remember. Growing up, even all of my toys were related to avation. This passion for aviation grew over time. Over the years, I got more are more interested about the science and math behind these machines. In my free time, I go to the Toronto Airport to spot planes. This gives me an opportunity to see these machines in action and learn more about them. Entering high school, I began to learn how to code and it quickly became a hobby. Since then, I have spent quite a bit of time learning new coding languages. Apart from this, I also love going outdoors and explore. I also enjoy playing new sports and taking up adventures.

                    <h3> Goals </h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a few goals that I want to achieve in the future. Firstly, I want to become a better version of my self and help my community. I want to attend the University of Waterloo for computer engineering. Another one of my goals is to play competitive badminton. In addition, I also want to learn more about coding and the different languages.

                    I have always been interested to learn new things and make a difference in my community. In grade 4, I won a silver medal in the English Olympiad and In grade 6, I got an academic excellence award. I also got honour roll in grade 8 and grade 9. When I started high school, I quickly became the member of the school’s ecosquad and yearbook club. During the summer, I worked hard to expand my coding language by learning to code in python with the free harvard CS50X course offered by edX. In addition, I also became a part of the vote housing campaign to help end homelessness and lower rent prices in Canada. Currently, I am the social media executive of our school’s South Asian Student Association. I am also member of the coding club since grade 9. Recently, I challenged myself and participated in the Canadian Computing Contest.
